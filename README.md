This repository contains the official implementation of the paper: [FCN4Flare: Fully Convolution Neural Networks for Flare Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21240).

## **Overview**

FCN4Flare is a fully convolutional neural network designed for precise point-to-point detection of stellar flares in photometric time-series data. Stellar flares provide valuable insights into stellar magnetic activity and space weather environments, but detecting these flares is challenging due to missing data, imbalanced classes, and diverse flare morphologies. FCN4Flare addresses these challenges with:

- **NaN Mask**: A mechanism to handle missing data points effectively during training.
- **Mask Dice Loss**: A loss function tailored to mitigate class imbalance by optimizing the overlap between predicted and true flares.

FCN4Flare achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Kepler flare dataset, significantly surpassing previous methods such as Flatwrm2 and Stella. Key performance metrics are summarized in the table below:

| Metric               | FCN4Flare | Flatwrm2 | Stella |
|----------------------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Recall               | **0.67**  | 0.26     | 0.50   |
| Precision            | **0.69**  | 0.08     | 0.09   |
| F1 Score             | **0.64**  | 0.13     | 0.16   |
| Average Precision    | **0.55**  | 0.12     | 0.14   |
| Dice Coefficient     | **0.64**  | 0.12     | 0.15   |
| Intersection over Union (IoU) | **0.54**  | 0.10     | 0.13   |

These results demonstrate FCN4Flare's robustness in accurately detecting flares while maintaining computational efficiency. With its open-source implementation and publicly available dataset, FCN4Flare is a valuable tool for stellar physics and time-domain astronomy research.


## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NAOC-LAMOST/fcn4flare.git
   cd fcn4flare
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## **Usage**

### **1. Reproduce the Results**
To reproduce the results in the paper, run:
```bash
./scripts/train.sh
```

### **2. Inference with AutoModel API**

```python
from transformers import AutoModel
import torch

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("Maxwell-Jia/fcn4flare")

# Load your data and create required tensors
# You need to implement your own data loading logic that returns:
# 1. input_features: tensor of flux values, shape [batch_size, sequence_length, 1]
#    - Contains the actual flux measurements and padded values
# 2. sequence_mask: binary tensor, shape [batch_size, sequence_length]
#    - 1 indicates real flux values
#    - 0 indicates padded positions
input_features, sequence_mask = load_data()

# Example of expected tensor shapes and values:
# input_features = torch.tensor([
#     [1.2, 1.5, 1.1, nan, nan],  # nan are padded values
#     [1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.2, 1.1]   # all real values
# ])
# sequence_mask = torch.tensor([
#     [1, 1, 1, 0, 0],  # last 2 positions are padded
#     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]   # no padding
# ])

logits = model(input_features, sequence_mask)

# Apply a threshold to get binary predictions
threshold = 0.5
predictions = (logits > threshold).float()

# Implement your own post-processing logic to reduce false positives
# The post-processing step is crucial for:
# 1. Filtering out noise and spurious detections
# 2. Merging nearby detections
# 3. Applying additional threshold or rule-based filtering
#
# Example post-processing strategies:
# - Apply minimum duration threshold
# - Merge events that are too close in time
# - Consider the amplitude of the detected events
# - Use domain knowledge to validate detections
final_results = post_process_predictions(predictions)

# Example implementation:
# def post_process_predictions(predictions):
#     # Apply minimum duration filter
#     # Remove detections shorter than X minutes
#     # Merge events within Y minutes of each other
#     # Apply additional validation rules
#     return processed_results
```

### **3. Inference with pipeline API**

```python
from transformers import pipeline

flare_detector = pipeline("flare-detection", model="Maxwell-Jia/fcn4flare")
# Only surport for Kepler/K2 light curves now.
results = flare_detector([
    "Path/to/your/lightcurve.fits",
    "Path/to/your/lightcurve.fits",
    ...
])

print(results)
```
